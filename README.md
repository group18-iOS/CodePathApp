## Baking Ideas

### App Description
The app allows users to input the ingredients they have and shows them the possible recipes they could make using only those ingredients.

### App Idea Evaluation

- Mobile: App would offer feature to take picture of ingredients and determine how much you have. Don't always have access to a computer, could use it grocery store to evaluate your shopping cart.
- Story: Sometimes people don't know what their options are when it comes to what they can make with what they have.
- Market: Anyone who is interested in baking.
- Habit: Few times a week.
- Scope: Generalized version of just listing recipes with ingredients is doable.
